## Project abstract

Support a continuous integration (CI) generation of SPDX files by creating a plugins or extensions to build tools. These plugins or extensions will generate valid SPDX documents based on the build file metadata and source files. 
The Yocto build environment currently has some SPDX file generation capabilities, but there is a need for some additional work to integrate some of the existing tools into a more complete integrated toolset. The SPDX Maven Plugin is an example of an existing build tool SPDX generator.

## Project goals

Write a build-tool agnostic plugin that can generate spdx file of an indicated project upon build.

## Development constraints

The first two project types selected were:
- Python projects
- Node projects

And as build tool, the integration had to be done on travis-CI.

## Development results

## How to test plugin
